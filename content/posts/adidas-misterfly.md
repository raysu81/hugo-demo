So back in 2012, I wasn't going to Ross stores to look for basketball shoes (I was mainly scouring ebay for deals back then). Until one day I dropped by the West Sacramento Ross and saw a pair of these--the **Adidas Misterfly**.

It's not signature or premium shoe, and it's actually a very plain and nonexpensive model produced by Adidas. I was hooked when it was my size of 8.5 and fit well, with the price of about $25 if I recall correctly. The price was just right.

It was a shoe worn by Tim Duncan, and as I would learn also other Adidas basketball players. It's a no frills shoe with basic tech: Adiprene cushioning, some "pods" gimmick for cushioning as well. But most notable I feel was the ankle collar TPU cage. It didn't provide all that much support, but it looked cool to me.

Anyways, this shoe is significant personally for me, for starting my Ross years. Meaning, after this find I started to drop by various Ross locations around the city. I would stop by when I was on the way somewhere and it was stop in between. Every Ross store was different with what inventory it had, so it was fun to discover some cool pairs that were in my size.

Over time my stash of shoes grew to where it is today, and hence my personal priorities have shifted. I no longer want to accumulate to many pairs, and want to start wearing what I have (hence the theme of my blog here).

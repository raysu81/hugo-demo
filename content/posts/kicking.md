## My personal motto is "Wear Your Shoes."

### Welcome to my personal blog. I started this blog for several reasons...

When I say "wear your shoes" it's meant as a metaphor for being grateful for what you already have. It means enjoying the simple things and being happy and humble, while having a happy outlook, balanced with ambition for goals that are personally fulfilling.

On a more literal--and practical--level, I had a knack over the years of collecting various discounted basketball shoes. So, this blog is to reflect on a goal of "wearing my shoes." Literally.

As Floofy the Cat can agree, I've got a a few pairs scattered around the house, and I want to stop purchasing any more, and start wearing them. This is in line with my north star of being happy with what you have.

These shoes are not anything special in regards to collectability and monetary value. But I would get joy by wearing them to play basketball in, and having them worn out. And then onto the next pair.

My goal here is to wear all my shoes, and then only keep a rotation of maybe... four pairs. Two outdoors and two indoors. I've already stopped the urge to buy any new bball shoes, and this helps my savings. Have to catch up on funding my retirement!

I hope to make many posts. Not only to track my history of shoe-wearing, but to have some some fun along the way, and learn a few new things while doing so!

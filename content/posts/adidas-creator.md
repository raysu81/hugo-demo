## One of my early Ross finds

### All Star East Blue 2010 colorway.

A great shoe, for only I think $30 at the time.

Difficult to lace properly with the shroud and zipper, but had a lockdown snug fit once laced, zipped, and strapped up.

Sole had good traction with the pods that reminded me of the older FeetYouWear design. Treads were fine so best indoors.

I still have my pair but now very worn, with sole coming unglued. Use it just for outdoor solo training and shoot-arounds.

Personal Fit: Very good for me.

Performance Grade: A+

Bargain Value: A+

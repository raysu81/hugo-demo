I made this blog site by following online tutorials--sometimes exact step by step. It's a static site using a Hugo template and hosted on Netlify.

Learned a lot already, and happy I was able to manage some of the oddities and challenges that came about.

I'm not very good at my webdev skills and knowledge, and want to get better.

As such, I want to set in writing for my goal of completing the following two Coursera certificates:

- [Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/programs/sacramento-public-library-chjfi/professional-certificates/meta-front-end-developer)
- [Meta Back-End Developer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/programs/sacramento-public-library-chjfi/professional-certificates/meta-back-end-developer)

Timeline:

Complete nearly all of both online cert programs by Sept 14. Leave just the "final project" to complete for both.

Then, do two more months after Sept 14, to complete front-end first, then back-end.

Will update this post after achieving this goal!

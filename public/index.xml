      <description>I made this blog site by following online tutorials&amp;ndash;sometimes exact step by step. It&amp;rsquo;s a static site using a Hugo template and hosted on Netlify.
Learned a lot already, and happy I was able to manage some of the oddities and challenges that came about.
I&amp;rsquo;m not very good at my webdev skills and knowledge, and want to get better.
As such, I want to set in writing for my goal of completing the following two Coursera certificates:</description>

      <description>These have a unique diamond patterned upper, but support feels flimsy.
Only worn casually thus far, but traction pattern doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem great for quick movements.
I like the look of these, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be a good performance shoe, especially for shifty players.</description>

      <description>One of my early Ross finds All Star East Blue 2010 colorway. A great shoe, for only I think $30 at the time.
Difficult to lace properly with the shroud and zipper, but had a lockdown snug fit once laced, zipped, and strapped up.
Sole had good traction with the pods that reminded me of the older FeetYouWear design. Treads were fine so best indoors.
I still have my pair but now very worn, with sole coming unglued.</description>

      <description>My personal motto is &amp;ldquo;Wear Your Shoes.&amp;rdquo; Welcome to my personal blog. I started this blog for several reasons&amp;hellip; When I say &amp;ldquo;wear your shoes&amp;rdquo; it&amp;rsquo;s meant as a metaphor for being grateful for what you already have. It means enjoying the simple things and being happy and humble, while having a happy outlook, balanced with ambition for goals that are personally fulfilling.
On a more literal&amp;ndash;and practical&amp;ndash;level, I had a knack over the years of collecting various discounted basketball shoes.</description>

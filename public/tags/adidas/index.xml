      <description>One of my early Ross finds All Star East Blue 2010 colorway. A great shoe, for only I think $30 at the time.
Difficult to lace properly with the shroud and zipper, but had a lockdown snug fit once laced, zipped, and strapped up.
Sole had good traction with the pods that reminded me of the older FeetYouWear design. Treads were fine so best indoors.
I still have my pair but now very worn, with sole coming unglued.</description>

      <description>So back in 2012, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to Ross stores to look for basketball shoes (I was mainly scouring ebay for deals back then). Until one day I dropped by the West Sacramento Ross and saw a pair of these&amp;ndash;the Adidas Misterfly.
It&amp;rsquo;s not signature or premium shoe, and it&amp;rsquo;s actually a very plain and nonexpensive model produced by Adidas. I was hooked when it was my size of 8.5 and fit well, with the price of about $25 if I recall correctly.</description>

      <description>One of my early Ross finds All Star East Blue 2010 colorway. A great shoe, for only I think $30 at the time.
Difficult to lace properly with the shroud and zipper, but had a lockdown snug fit once laced, zipped, and strapped up.
Sole had good traction with the pods that reminded me of the older FeetYouWear design. Treads were fine so best indoors.
I still have my pair but now very worn, with sole coming unglued.</description>
